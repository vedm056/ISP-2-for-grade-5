                Coding is just writing instructions that a computer follows. It includes creating code or programs using programming languages that are made to do a certain task or solve a problem. Coding is the main part of all the software, applications, and websites that we use all the time. It's a skill that helps us control computers and create technology that can do multiple tasks, from simple calculations to controlling the WWW (World Wide Web). Another thing is that coding is not just limited to the tech industry because it's used in various fields such as helping people with healthcare, education, and amusement. Learning to code can open up a lot of job opportunities and is a useful skill in the world. It's a cool process that combines logic, problem solving, and designing stuff, and so it allows for the creation of solutions and improvements in electronics. Even if you're interested in developing websites, creating phone apps, or scanning data, coding is the main skill that will help you achieve these goals.</div><div class="layer1">

                You should code because it gives you access to numerous improvements, such as increasing problem-solving skills, helping with the creation of apps and websites, and opening up a lotÂ  of career opportunities. It's a skill that helps with logical thinking and accuracy, because coding requires a clear understanding of what you want the computer to do. Moreover, coding can be a creative skill, allowing people to bring their ideas to life and see them more in usage. With the increasing importance of technology in some places, coding skills are becoming more valuable in job options.</div><div class="layer1">

              <section id="tab-3"><div class="layer">Coding errors occur when a mistake or an illogical program is made. Here are some examples: Syntax errors are grammar mistakes in languages where a problem with the coding rules of the programming language leads to issues that prevent the program from running correctly. These can range from missing semicolons to the wrong use of coding syntax in a command or function. Logic errors come when the code does not follow the commands as expected, which usually leads to bad results without any syntax issues. Understanding these errors is important for programmers because it gives them access to debug properly and improves the accuracy of their code. When there are logic or semantic errors, unit testing and code reviews are good tricks for figuring out the problem and its solution. To avoid errors, it is important for developers to have a good understanding of the programming languages they are using. As programming languages and development environments improve slowly, they start to include better error detection and correction features, helping developers write better, more bugless code.</div> <div class="layer1">

              <section id="tab-4"><div class="layer">IDEs are software apps that provide advanced features to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally has a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. The most modern IDEs have code completion. Some IDEs, like Eclipse, contain a compiler, interpreter, or both. Opponents like Dharpdevelop and Lazarus don't have those features. Examples of popular IDEs include Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (I use this), which is liked for its easy-to-use structure and wide language support. The next one is IntelliJ IDEA, known for its advanced code analysis and suggestions for improvement. Visual Studio code is also liked for being open-source and free to use. On the other hand, IntelliJ IDEA offers a lot of features, like version control and code completion, but you have to pay for them. Other notable IDEs are Eclipse, known for its good Java environment, and PyCharm, which is good for Python development. Each IDE offers interresting features and tools designed to enhance productivity and increase the speed of the coding process for developers.</div> <div class="layer1">

It's essential for creating interactive and responsive websites, which is also why it's good for both front-end and back-end development. HTML and CSS are also mandatory for web development because they provide the structure and style of web pages. Python has also emerged as a significant player in the web development workspace because it's good for back-end programming. Its basic syntax and reliable libraries make it a favorite among developers for building complex web applications. Python's frameworks, like Django and Flask, have also helped Python be a go-to language for quick development. Other languages like Java, Ruby, PHP, C#, and Swift also play important roles in web development. Java, with its strong system, is usually favored for advanced applications. Ruby, known for its interesting syntax, helps the Ruby on Rails framework, which emphasizes convention over configuration. C# has gained fame by working within the.NET framework. Swift, even though it is mostly for iOS and macOS app development, has also gotten into web development because of its performance and safety features.

It is made of a lot of commands that control the machine's movements. For example, the command G00 is used for quick positioning by moving the machine to a specified point quickly. The G01 command is used for linear interpolation and tells the machine to move in a straight line to a specific position at a specific speed. To use G-code, you have to understand how to read and write these commands, which are often generated by software but can also be written or modified by hand for more control over the machine's actions. Learning G-code is mandatory for people who use CNC machines or 3D printers because it is the main language that controls these devices.</div><div class="layer3">

He was a computer scientist who was mostly known for his power-hungry invention of the World Wide Web (WWW). This was the first web browser. His contributions to the web world are great and have a massive impact. Tim Berners-Lee's genius lies in his talent to invent and develop HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which are the main technologies of the web. With his hard work and perseverance, he could officially improve the digital world, which allowed him to create cool and easy sharing and accessing of information on the internet. Here was his early life: he was born on June 8, 1955, in London, England, and he was the son of mathematicians who worked on the first commercial computer. Tim Berners-Lee had a fascination with computers because his parents were involved in the Ferranti Mark 1. As a young adult, Tim Berners-Lee attended The Queen's College in Oxford. In college, he received a first-class degree in physics in 1976. After his university degree, he began his job in the tech industry, which eventually led him to invent the World Wide Web.

It's concept was made at a time when the power of digital computers had just started to be explored. Plankalkul's structure helped create the expression of complex calculations and operations, which were mandatory in advancing computing theory and practice.

It started with the first web language, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, making up the basis of internet content. HTML made it easy to structure the HTML document and link between styles, which was very advanced at the time. When the internet evolved, a lot of people needed more advanced styling and interactivity, which meant CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) had to be created. It was created in 1996, and JavaScript was created in 1995. These languages transformed basic HTML pages into dynamic, interactive experiences. In the 1990s and 2000s, the dot-com bubble brought internet-related investments and increased internet tech. After that, with the coming of Web 2.0 in the early 2000s, user-generated content and social media were easier to make, with software like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allowing more fancier websites. The 2000s had also had the mobile increment, with the start of smartphones helping create responsive web design and ensure content was accessible across any devices.
